This is a study that uses Android studios to build apps for university students. I don't have enough, but I try to save it here to leave a record.
Through gps, your location appears on the Google map inside the app, and when you click on each button, the appropriate restaurant location is displayed on the map. 
Click to reveal the text above the business hours and locations, and then click on the speech bubble to reveal the restaurant's menu.
